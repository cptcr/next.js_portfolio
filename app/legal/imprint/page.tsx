              As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content on these pages according to
              general laws. However, I am not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party
              information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.

            <p>
              Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain
              unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of
              knowledge of a specific legal violation. Upon becoming aware of such legal violations,
              I will remove this content immediately.

            <p>
              My website contains links to external third-party websites, over whose content I have
              no influence. Therefore, I cannot assume any liability for these external contents.
              The respective provider or operator of the linked pages is always responsible for the
              content of the linked pages.
            </p>
            <p>
              The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking.
              Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. However, permanent
              monitoring of the content of the linked pages is unreasonable without concrete
              evidence of a violation of law. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, I will remove
              such links immediately.
